# densityestimation

This module contains functions to work with density estimation, expeccially designed for medium to high dimensionnal situations.

- Evaluation : kernel density estimation, dtm with parallelized implementation (multithread cpu version and gpu using pytorch)
- Optimisation : implementation of methods to find optimal bandwith : cross-validation, rodeo ...
